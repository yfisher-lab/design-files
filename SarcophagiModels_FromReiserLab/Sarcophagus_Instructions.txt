Sarcophagi model instructions:

The info we gave the machinist is that 'the holes along the side will work for countersinking and threading a loose fit 2-56 cap screw without any of the metal becoming too thin to machine.'

The contact for the machinist Wilson Lab used is Chris Leyds, and his company,
Creatrix, is based in the Netherlands. Here is his email: c.leyds@crtrx.com


Note: there was a slight discrepancy between the distance to the wall of the side holes in two of the files.
Contact Michael Reiser to request an updated version of the file.
